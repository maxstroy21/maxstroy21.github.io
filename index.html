      <h1><!-- Blog title -->Projection modeling</h1>
      
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      
      <p>Let the task is to create an information system in which anyone can register to create models of their ideas about a real or imaginary world. To this problem, we add the following conditions:</p>      
      <ol>
      	<li><p>Models should be scalable. This means that any object can become part of the synthesized object (the result of the synthesis process), or be divided into parts (the result of the analysis process). In this synthesis and analysis can be done in different ways. This means that the same object can become part of different designs, or an object can be divided into parts in many ways.</p></li>
      	<li><p>One and the same object can be called different subjects in different ways. IP should support the ability to model representations of the imaginary or real world from different perspectives.</p></li>
      	<li><p>Models must satisfy the condition of extensibility. This means that any model can be continued by the same, or another subject, in any direction, taking into account the change of point of view.</p></li>
      	<li><p>Models must satisfy the principle of anthropocentricity. That is, you can not invent ideas that are different from those to which a person is accustomed. That is, we do not consider the representations created by artificial intelligence and the languages created by them for describing these representations.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>To create such an information system, we need a body of knowledge, about which I am going to tell in my articles. I call this arch a projection modeling, because the method presented in it is very similar to a descriptive geometry. Just as in the descriptive geometry projections are made on three orthogonal planes, and in projection modeling we make projections. But since our world is four-dimensional, the projections of 4-D objects are made for time and space. Mixed projections are possible, but they will require a language that we do not have at our disposal. Just as in the descriptive geometry, the nature of the projected volume does not matter, so in projection modeling the interpretation of the projection goes over the projection surface. That is, two subjects can interpret the same projection in different ways. One can interpret the projection as a machine, the second as an amphibian.</p>
      
      <h3><!-- Tagline -->Basic concepts</h3>
      
      <p>In order to understand what projections we are doing, consider the following classification:</p>

   <ol> 
   
   <li><p>An object is a representation of the projection of a 4-D volume onto a space without knowledge of its structure.</p></li>
    <li><p>A structure is a representation of the projection of a 4-D volume onto space as a "finite" set of objects or substances.</p></li>
    <li><p>A substance is a representation of the projection of 4-D volume onto space as an "infinite" set of objects, substances or structures.</p></li>
    
    </ol>


<p>I will explain by examples. The object is the surface. This surface can be treated as a cobblestone. The structure can be treated as a construction. For example, the design of the aircraft consists of tail, wings and fuselage. A substance is a description of the structure. For example, a "piece of rubber" is a description in the form of "substance in the form of a set of substances" (that is, the substance consists of a substance), "a crystal consists of atoms" - this description is in the form of "a substance consists of a set of objects", "water in the glass consists of molecules, each of which consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom" - this description in the form "substance consists of a multitude of structures".</p>

<p>An object whose size can be neglected within the framework of the problem being solved is called a material point.</p>

<p>Let's try to do the same with the 4-D projections for a while. To this end, consider the classification:</p>
     
 	 <ol>
    <li><p>The time interval is a representation of the 4-D volume projection for a time as an interval of time, the structure of which is unknown to us.</p></li>
     <li><p>The temporal structure is a representation of the 4-D volume projection for a while as a "finite" number of intervals and functions.</p></li>
     <li><p>A temporal substance is a representation of the projection of a 4-D volume for a time as an "infinite" number of intervals, temporal substances and temporal structures.</p></li>
     </ol>
     
     <p>I will explain by examples. the time interval can be treated as an operation. The temporal structure can be treated as a scenario. The scenario explains how the state of objects change, new ones appear, old ones are destroyed. The scenario can have both functions and operations. For example, the scenario "push off the earth, fly until your feet touch the ground, make a rollover" consists of two operations and one function. The temporal substance can be treated as a function. For example, as a function of the rotation of the shaft of a particular engine. This is a rotation function consisting of rotation functions. It can be interpreted as a function of contracting. This is a function consisting of operations. It can be treated as a function of aircraft construction, consisting of the sequences of operations "purchase of spare parts - assembly of the aircraft - shipment of the aircraft." This function consists of scenario.</p>

    <p>The time interval, the duration of which can be neglected, can be treated as an event.</p>
    
    <h3>Language difficulties</h3>
     
     <p>When we read definitions of terms, we do not distinguish between the definition of an object as an object, the definition of an object as a structure, and the definition of an object as a substance. For example, you can hear that an airplane is a vehicle for transporting goods and passengers through the air. But you can hear that the aircraft is a vehicle consisting of a fuselage, wings and a tail. These two definitions define different projections of 4-D volumes: projections in the form of an object and projections in the form of a construction. For the designer, it is very important to separate these two definitions, because they require different models. But in practice, we usually do not notice the difference in these definitions. All because the context in which we are is inclines us to an unambiguous interpretation of definitions. For example, we perceive a train as a structure. Cobblestone is like an object, milk is like a substance. But we do not realize how we make this choice. Even worse - in the language there is no clear indication of how to treat this or that term. Therefore, we often do not distinguish between an object and a structure, calling them one term. For example, an airplane can be treated like this, and so on. A similar problem arose in the body of knowledge called system engineering. In this body of knowledge, both the object and the structure have one name - the system. Therefore, when I hear this term, I have to make efforts to understand from the context what is at issue now: the bridge or its construction.</p>
     <p>To model substances and temporal substances of predicates of the first order is not enough. It is necessary to be able to construct statements in predicates of the second order, that is, one must be able to model statements about sets.
     
     <h3>Conclusions</h3>

     <p>To meet the stated requirements, it is necessary to divide the following steps:</p>

     <ol>
     <li><p>Learn to identify entities through the interpretation of projections of 4-D volume. This can be seen from the example of a function definition. I have not seen anything like this before.</p></li>
     <li><p>Learn how to separate the projection of 4-D volume from its interpretation. That is, two subjects, having made the same projection of 4-D volume, can treat this projection in different ways (for one this will be a transaction for the sale, for another it will be a transaction for the purchase).</p></li>
